Hy, Everyone its a Full_Stack Food Delievery App which has divided into three parts:

The first part of project is FrontEnd which allows user to login/register and add/remove food items into cart and they can proceed to checkout after  done with payment they will be redirected to order page where they can see there previous orders and keep track of current orders.

The second part of project is Admin Pannel where you can control orders, you can add/remove foods, you can change status of users ordered food and also can access of all food items.

The third part is BackEnd which designs on modern technologie such as NodeJs, Express, and MongoDB database, i also used external laibraries to make this application secure and powerful such as validator, bcrypt for hashing user password and multer for images.


Note: We will fix it later and we have to exchnage multer with firebase...
